        "In short, you take an array (usually 3x3 or 5x5) and pass it over the image. By changing the underlying pixels based on the formula within that matrix, you can do things like edge detection. So, for example, if you look at the above link, you'll see a 3x3 that is defined for edge detection where the middle cell is 8, and all of its neighbors are -1. In this case, for each pixel, you would multiply its value by 8, then subtract the value of each neighbor. Do this for every pixel, and you'll end up with a new image that has the edges enhanced.\n",

The print (test_labels[;100]) shows us the first 100 labels in the test set, and you can see that the ones at index 0, index 23 and index 28 are all the same value (9). They're all shoes. Let's take a look at the result of running the convolution on each, and you'll begin to see common features between them emerge. Now, when the DNN is training on that data, it's working with a lot less, and it's perhaps finding a commonality between shoes based on this convolution/pooling combination."
